This new iteration of my personal homepage is up and runningâ€”welcome.

More content is of course to come, in the way of posts on everything, projects that I'm working on, writing that I've done, and interesting links that I want to share. Also, I'm sure there will be endless tweaks to the look and feel of this site. There will be _tinkering_.

Again, welcome. I hope you find something interesting.
